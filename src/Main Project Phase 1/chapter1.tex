\chapter{Introduction}

In the dynamic landscape of autonomous systems, the paramount challenge lies in enabling machines to interpret and navigate through their environments with a level of sophistication close to human perception. At the core of this challenge is the processing of visual data, a fundamental aspect that governs the decision-making capabilities of autonomous entities such as self-driving cars and wheeled robots. This project report delves into the pivotal role played by automatic segmentation and labeling in advancing the perceptual capacities of these autonomous systems, addressing challenges in scalability, efficiency, and safety.

\noindent
The main focus of this work is on the pivotal task of automatically segmenting and labeling objects within videos. This process involves dissecting visual data into distinct segments, each representing specific objects or areas of interest, and assigning categorical tags to these segments. The traditional method relies heavily on manual annotation, a time-consuming and resource-intensive approach that hampers the scalability and efficiency of training autonomous systems. The aim is to revolutionize this process by exploring innovative techniques that streamline object segmentation and labeling, paving the way for more efficient and scalable video analysis in complex environments.\\

\section{Background}

The conventional method of manually annotating datasets, a foundational practice in the training of autonomous systems, has encountered formidable challenges in recent times. As the complexity and scope of these systems expand, there is a growing need for more extensive and diverse datasets. However, the manual annotation of such datasets has become a bottleneck, both in terms of time and resources. The labor-intensive nature of this process not only slows down the overall development and training of autonomous systems but also introduces the risk of human error, potentially undermining the accuracy and efficiency of environmental perception.

\noindent
In response to the limitations imposed by manual annotation, the concept of automating segmentation and labeling has emerged as a pivotal advancement. Drawing upon the strides made in computer vision and machine learning, automated segmentation and labeling present an alternative that is not only more efficient but also highly scalable. By harnessing algorithms capable of discerning patterns and features in visual data, this approach liberates human annotators from the burdensome task of individually labeling each object in an image. Instead, machines take on the responsibility of segmenting and labeling, allowing human annotators to focus on more nuanced aspects of the training process. The challenges faced by autonomous systems extend beyond the realm of dataset annotation, particularly when these systems are deployed in real-time applications. Autonomous vehicles navigating through unpredictable traffic scenarios and real-time surveillance systems monitoring dynamic environments demand rapid and precise object identification. Traditional manual annotation processes struggle to meet the real-time demands of such applications, where decisions must be made swiftly. The need for instantaneous environmental perception necessitates the integration of automated segmentation and labeling, ensuring that these systems can process visual data on the fly, make split-second decisions, and adapt to dynamic changes in their surroundings. This intersection of real-time requirements and the limitations of manual processes underscores the urgency for innovative solutions that automated segmentation and labeling can provide.
