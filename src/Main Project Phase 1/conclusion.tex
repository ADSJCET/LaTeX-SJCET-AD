% \noindent
% In conclusion, Image and video segmentation and labeling hold incredible importance across numerous domains due to their multiple roles. These processes are instrumental in object recognition, enabling the identification and detection of specific elements within visual data, a vital function for applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical imaging. The semantic understanding derived from segmentation aids in comprehending context, supporting tasks like satellite imagery analysis and surveillance. Moreover, these techniques provide annotated data crucial for training machine learning models, particularly in computer vision, enhancing the accuracy of algorithms. Segmentation and labeling also underpin augmented and virtual reality applications by enabling the seamless integration of digital information into real-world environments. In video analysis, these processes facilitate object tracking, motion analysis, and event recognition, which are pivotal in fields like surveillance and sports analysis. The initial phase of this project focused on real-time image segmentation and labeling, employing the SAM model for segmentation and YOLO for object detection. Which, on the segmentation process worked effectively, but object detection needs more training in more classes. Future enhancements could involve refining the object detection model to encompass finer-grained categorizations for improved accuracy and specificity in labeling object components within images and videos.
