  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
The project focuses mainly on handwritten number identification, which address one of the most daunting challenges faced by any educational institutions globally - recognition and classification of handwritten digits from answer scripts. The proposed system can implement the idea of handwritten digit recognition for the pressing problem faced by educators in educational institutions – the manual mark entry. The need for a transformative solution to streamline and enhance the efficiency of the mark entry process in colleges was recognized, through extensive research and analysis.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent The idea of a user-friendly software tool that harnesses the power of OCR technology in conjunction with state-of-the-art AI to convert images of mark cells on answer scripts of the institution into a CSV file with minimal intervention of teachers, was conceived. The system aims to simplify the entire mark entry process by providing a user-friendly interface for teachers to capture images of the answer scripts using a camera that converts the obtained images of marks into data that will be stored in a CSV file. The resulting CSV file represents the original content of the answer scripts, enabling the teachers to effortlessly edit, analyze, and evaluate the mark data.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent The approach taken involved implementing advanced OCR algorithms, fine-tuned to extract mark cells on answer scripts with utmost precision and reliability. Leveraging cutting-edge frameworks such as TensorFlow, Numpy, and Pandas, a seamless pipeline was engineered to efficiently organize and format the extracted data. The necessary features were only selected from the extracted data using a CNN model, which was built from scratch. The result was an output that depicted that the model performed better compared to the existing solutions available. It also exhibited remarkable flexibility, allowing for effortless customization to cater to the specific needs of users.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent In summary, this project aims to reduce the time consumed for the mark entry process in educational institutions. While the focus initially was laid on transforming the mark data entry procedures within educational institutions, one can envision a future where the modular system finds applications in diverse domains, simplifying complex data handling tasks and alleviating manual labor on a grand scale.
